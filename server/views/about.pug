                    p I did my studies from kurnool, a small city in the southern part of the country. Did a lot of projects which weren't part of the curicullum in the college. I did computer science from a college which is not too fancy, it is a small college but I am thank full to those 4 years of graduation that gave me life and presented me a pool of oppurtunities and made me what I am.
